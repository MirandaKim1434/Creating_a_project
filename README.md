### Creating a Project

1. Create Project
    * `mkdir $project_name`

2. Finding Project
    * `cd $project_name`

3. Writing and Running:
    * Create file name: _main.rs_
 ```rust 
fn main() { 
    println!("hello!"); 
}
```

4. Save file

5. Go back to terminal window

```sh
 rustc main.rs
 ./main

```
   * Regardless of operating system, the string project name should print to the terminal. If you donâ€™t see this refer to troubleshooting.

   * If it printed you have written the program
